<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Carotid Artery Stents Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Balloon-Expandable Stents</li><li>Self-Expanding Stents</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The Carotid Artery Stents market features two main types: balloon-expandable stents and self-expanding stents. Balloon-expandable stents are deployed using a balloon catheter that expands the stent to fit the artery's diameter, providing a rigid structure after inflation. In contrast, self-expanding stents are designed to expand automatically upon deployment, adjusting to the vessel's shape and providing continuous support. Both types aim to enhance blood flow and reduce the risk of stroke by maintaining open carotid arteries in patients with atherosclerosis.</p></p>
