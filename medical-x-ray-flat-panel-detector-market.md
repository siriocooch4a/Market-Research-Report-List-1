<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Medical X-ray Flat Panel Detector Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Indirect Conversion</li><li>Direct Conversion</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The medical X-ray flat panel detector market comprises two main types: indirect conversion and direct conversion. Indirect conversion detectors use a scintillator to convert X-rays into visible light, which is then captured by a photodiode array. This technology typically offers lower production costs and better sensitivity. In contrast, direct conversion detectors convert X-rays directly into electrical signals using photoconductive materials, resulting in higher image quality and reduced image lag. Both types cater to varying clinical needs and preferences in diagnostic imaging.</p></p>
